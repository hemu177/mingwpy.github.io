********************************
Why choose mingw-w64 over mingw?
********************************

:term:`mingw-w64` is a fork of the :term:`mingw` project.

To date, numpy and scipy have used versions of the mingw compilers to create
32-bit binary distributions on Windows.  mingw-w64 has some major advantages
over mingw, including:

* support for compiling 64-bit extensions (as well as 32-bit);
* large file support;
* winpthread pthreads implementation, MIT licenced;
* more active development.

*********************
The mingw-w64 project
*********************

The mingw-w64 project releases the supporting files to allow the standard
:term:`gcc` distribution to compile code that can:

* make many standard Windows API calls;
* link against standard :term:`MSCRT` :term:`runtime library` files.

Among the files the project provides are:

* ``mingw-w64-headers`` |--| header files specific to the Windows
  implementation.
* ``mingw-w64-crt`` |--| code for C / C++ runtime libraries (providing
  functions not directly or reliably available from the MSCRT);
* ``mingw-w64-libraries`` |--| libraries for using POSIX threads (`winpthreads
  <http://locklessinc.com/articles/pthreads_on_windows/>`_), working with MSVC
  symbol name mangling (`libmangle
  <http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/libmangle>`_), Windows store compatibility
  (`winstorecompat
  <http://www.jbkempf.com/blog/post/2013/Technical-update-on-the-WinRT-port>`_),
  structured exception handling (`pseh <http://www.reactos.org/wiki/PSEH>`_);
* ``mingw-w64-tools`` |--| tools for: generating DLL export definition
  (``def``) files (`gendef
  <http://sourceforge.net/p/mingw-w64/wiki2/gendef>`_); working with the
  `Microsoft Interface Description Language
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Interface_Definition_Language>`_
  (`genidl <http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/genidl.1.html>`_,
  `widl <http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/widl.1.html>`_);
  modifying `PE`_ flags in Windows executable files (`genpeimg`).

The project has official source releases on sourceforge: see `mingw-w64 source
releases`_.

In order to use mingw-w64 implementations to compile real code, you will need
a mingw-w64 compiler toolchain.

**********************
The compiler toolchain
**********************

To build software with mingw-w64 you will likely need:

* the compiler (gcc, compiled from standard gcc sources), augumented with the
  mingw-w64 extensions, including Windows-specific headers and runtime
  libraries;
* a build of the GNU :term:`binutils` tools, containing utility programs such
  as ``ld``, ``ar``, ``dlltool``.

********************
C++ exception models
********************

The mingw-w64 compiler can be built with different ways of handling C++
exceptions. See `mingw-w64 exception handling`_ and `SO post on mingw-w64
exception handling`_ for background.

The exception handling modes are:

* Dwarf2: only supported building for 32-bit Windows targets;
* setjmp / longjmp (SJLJ): "much slower than Dwarf2", but compatible on 32 and
  64 bits;
* `Structured exception handling`_ (SEH): the standard MSVC exception handling
  mechanism, `supported in 64-bit GCC since version 4.8
  <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.mingw.w64.general/5920>`_.  SEH
  `still not supported <http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/contribute>`_ for 32-bit
  targets.

****************
Threading models
****************

The mingw-w64 compiler can also be built with different threading models. The
options are:

* POSIX threads (full C++11/C11 threading features);
* win32 threads (No C++11 multithreading features).

See these SO posts:

* `difference bewteen posix and win32 threads in mingw-w64
  <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13212342/whats-the-difference-between-thread-posixs-and-thread-win32-in-gcc-port-of-windo>`_
* `posix vs win32
  <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17242516/mingw-w64-threads-posix-vs-win32>`_

*************************************
A more complete software build system
*************************************

In practice, for building software, you will usually want a wider range of
tools than just the compiler and binutils utilities.  In particular you will
probably want tools like the ``bash`` shell, ``make``, and the `GNU build
system <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system>`_.

MSYS2_ provides these.  msys2 is the successor of msys. Msys2 is necessary as
environment for the mingw build process on Windows.  -

*********************************
Official mingw-w64 GCC toolchains
*********************************

'recommended' builds are available from the mingw-builds project via
http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/download.php |--| for example:

- `64-bit target, SEH exceptions, posix threads
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/4.8.2/threads-posix/seh>`_
- `32-bit target, dwarf 2 exceptions, posix threads
  <http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/4.8.2/threads-posix/dwarf>`_

These are common combinations of exception and thread models. You can find
other combinations as well. Exception handling affects C++ development. Don't
ever link object code with different types of exception and/or thread
handling!
